# Become Part Of The 1% #

## Description ##
- My motivation for this project is to try protray my first website as a business model. My hope for this site is to provide Marathon training for anyone interested in training for one while keeping the website simple and sleek with enough information to motivate people to want to commit to the training program with out the information being overwhelming. 
- This is my first HTML/CSS project so they are the only two technologies used throughout the project. 
- I found the media queries for this quite challenging and getting used to correctly targeting elements. 
- This site is very basic and only has three interactive elements which are the Navbar, the sign-up page and the footer.
- I hope to make the training section interactive in the future and add features which allow people who have signed up to the training to input their stats from any runs they have completed so they can have it to look back on their progress throughout the training.

## User Experience ##

## Design ##
#### Colour scheme ####
- The main colours of the site are black, white and green.

#### Typeography ####
- The Font used in the headings on the page is Rubik and Karla for the body of the site. They 
work well together as a pair and have a sleek and modren look. I have used Sans-serif as a fall back font. 

#### Imagery ####

 - This is the image I would like to use as the background image for the training week 1 section: https://unsplash.com/photos/0xpFNUjzdbw (image of a race track)
