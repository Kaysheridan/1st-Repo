## Motivation ##
- My motivation for this project is to try protray my first website as a business model. My hope for this site is to provide Marathon training for anyone internested in training for one while keeping the website simple and sleek with enough information to motivate people to want to commit to the training program with out the information being overwhelming. 

### User Experience ###
- I want visitors to the site to be able to nvaigate the site with ease.
- I want visitors to the site to understand the purpose of the site.

### Design ###
#### Colour scheme ####
- The main colours of the site are going to be black, white and green.

#### Typeography ####
- The Font used in the headings on the page is going to be Rubik and Karla for the body of the site. They 
work well together as a pair and have a sleek and modren look. I will used Sans-serif as a fall back font.
